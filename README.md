2019-09-26 Started tracking readme file, added lab3conv.c and started lab3flags.c very confused tho
2019-12-19 Finished both EECS2030 and EECS2031, 
           2030: Advanced Object Oriented Programming
           - https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~jackie/teaching/lectures/index.html#EECS2030_F19
  Learnt:         
           - Aliasing & Alias paths, tracing between object creation and accessor & mutator methods
           - Short Circuit Evaluation, Method Overloading & Basics of static vs non static variables
           - Handling exceptions (Throws) (Catch-Specify) etc
           - Reading Junit Test cases (Although I'm still a bit unfamiliar on how to create them properly)
           - Aliasing (single reference vs Array-referenced)
           - Defining and overriding equals Method
           - Defining and overriding ompareTo Method (although barely used in class)
           - HashMap, HashCode and talked about the idea of bucket arrays (but never went in depth)
           - ArrayList vs HashTable
           - Solving problems recursively (Though I still have a bit of a hard time reading someone elses recursive code)
                - But I can make my own basics ones to solve basic* problems like merging 2 sorted arrays using recursion
           - ***
