/*
 * You are required to use the given `dict` array to implement the methods.
 * See test_one_array_implementation_insert and test_one_array_implementation_remove 
 * in class TestArrayImplementations.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * 		- You are not allowed to add new attributes to this class.
 * 		- You are not allowed to use any Java collection library (no import statements).
 * 
 * The idea is that `dict` is initialized as an array of size `MAX_CAPACITY` with each slot storing null.
 * Entries are added from left to right, whereas all free slots remain null.
 * When an entry is removed, all slots to its right are shifted to the left to close the gap.
 * 
 * For example, given a dictionary with four entries:
 * {(w1, d1), (w2, d2), (w3, d3), (w4, d4), null, null, ...} 
 * Removing the entry for word `w2` has the resulting dictionary:
 * {(w1, d1), (w3, d3), (w4, d4), null, null, null, ...}
 * 
 * You may consider studying this note on manipulating basic array:
