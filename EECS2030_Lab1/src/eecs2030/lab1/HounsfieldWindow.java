/**
 * A class that represents a windowed view of Hounsfield units. A Hounsfield
 * window is defined by two values: (1) the window level, and (2) the window
 * width. The window level is the Hounsfield unit value that the window is
 * centered on. The window width is the range of Hounsfield unit values that the
 * window is focused on.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A window has a lower and upper bound. The lower bound is defined as the
 * window level minus half the window width:
 * 
 * <p>
 * lo = level - (width / 2)
 * 
 * <p>
 * The upper bound is defined as the window level plus half the window width:
 * 
 * <p>
 * hi = level + (width / 2)
 * 
 * <p>
 * Hounsfield units are mapped by the window to a real number in the range of
 * {@code 0} to {@code 1}. A Hounsfield unit with a value less than lo is mapped
 * to the value {@code 0}. A Hounsfield unit with a value greater than hi is
 * mapped to the value {@code 1}. A Hounsfield unit with a value v between lo
 * and hi is mapped to the value:
 * 
 * <p>
 * (v - lo) / width
 *
